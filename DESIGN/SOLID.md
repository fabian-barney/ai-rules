# SOLID

Concise, practical guidance for the SOLID principles.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- A module should have one reason to change.
- Keep responsibilities narrow and cohesive.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Extend behavior through new code, not by modifying existing behavior.
- Favor abstractions and composition when change is expected.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Subtypes must be usable in place of supertypes without breaking correctness.
- Avoid strengthening preconditions or weakening postconditions in overrides.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
- Do not force clients to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- Keep high-level policy independent of low-level details.
