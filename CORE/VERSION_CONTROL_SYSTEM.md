# VERSION_CONTROL_SYSTEM

Guidance for version control system usage (Git and others).

## Commit Messages
- Always include the ticket or issue identifier and ticket/issue title (or a
  concise equivalent summary aligned with that title).
- Example format: `<ticket-or-issue-id> <ticket-or-issue-title>: <change>`.
- Add optional context about what changed and why when it improves clarity.
- Mark breaking changes explicitly.

## Branch and PR/MR Workflow
- Mandatory execution order for implementation concerns:
  `plan -> dedicated branch -> implement -> PR/MR -> review -> merge (if
  permitted, typically by maintainers)`.
- Link each implementation concern to one issue/ticket and keep branch/PR/MR
  scope aligned to that single concern.
- Create a dedicated branch for each new concern being implemented (usually one
  issue/ticket).
- Keep each branch scoped to that single concern.
- Push successful intermediate states to VCS so progress stays recoverable.
- Do not push knowingly non-working code unless this is explicitly requested.
- Create a PR/MR for implementation work before reporting completion when you
  have access to GitHub, GitLab, or a similar review system.
- When opening a PR/MR, auto-detect the target branch from downstream-project
  rules when available; otherwise ask which target branch to use and suggest
  the most likely one.
- If you cannot create the branch or PR/MR due to permission/tooling constraints,
  stop and report `BLOCKED` with the concrete reason instead of bypassing the
  workflow.
- When merge permission is not available, the hand-off point is a review-ready
  PR/MR and completion should be reported via the completion status contract.

## PR/MR and Issue Tracker Summaries
- When creating a PR/MR, include an implementation summary aimed at code
  reviewers.
- If you have access to the review platform, add that summary directly to the
  PR/MR description or comment thread.
- Also provide a short bullet-point summary on the linked issue/ticket for
  Product Owners, Code Reviewers, and Testers/QA.
- If you have access to the issue tracker, add that summary directly to the
  linked issue/ticket.

## Completion Status Contract
- Final delivery for implementation work must include:
  - `Plan:`
  - `Issue/Ticket:`
  - `Branch:` (or `Branch: BLOCKED` / `Branch: N/A` when branch creation is not
    possible; explain the reason under `BLOCKED: <reason>`)
  - `PR/MR:` (or `BLOCKED: <reason>` when the PR/MR and/or branch cannot be
    created)
  - `Validation:`
- Use platform-neutral `PR/MR` wording in shared guidance.

## PR/MR Review Comment Handling
- Evaluate every review comment and explicitly judge whether it is valid or not
  for the current scope.
- Reply to every review comment with a respectful, concrete response. Do not
  leave actionable comments unanswered.
- If the comment is valid:
  - Apply a fix in the same PR/MR when appropriate.
  - If not fixed immediately, create or link a follow-up issue/ticket and
    explain why deferral is acceptable.
- If the comment is not valid, explain the reasoning with project-specific
  context and keep the tone factual and professional.
- When appropriate, mark the relevant review thread or conversation as resolved,
  but first check downstream project rules for ownership (for example whether
  the author or reviewer is expected to mark threads resolved).
- Do not mark a review thread or conversation resolved by deleting discussion;
  keep decisions auditable in the comment thread.

## Dependency Lock Files
- Commit dependency lock files for the package managers used by the project
  (for example `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`).
- Do not add ignore rules that exclude required lock files from VCS.
- In CI, install dependencies from lock files in frozen/immutable mode when
  supported by the package manager.
- Exceptions are allowed only when explicitly documented (for example,
  intentionally published libraries that choose not to commit lock files).

## Ignore File
- Maintain a VCS ignore file in the repository root (for Git: `.gitignore`).
- Keep the ignore list minimal but practical to prevent VCS pollution and protect sensitive files.
- Start from a baseline set, then add project- or tool-specific entries as needed.
- Remove or override entries if the repository intentionally versions those files.

### Minimal Must-Have Ignores
Secrets
- `.env`, `.env.*` (except `.env.example`)
- `.envrc`
- `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`
- `*.jks`, `*.keystore`

OS and editor noise
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `Desktop.ini`
- `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*~`
- `.idea/`, `.vscode/`

Build output, dependencies, caches, logs
- `target/`, `build/`, `dist/`, `out/`
- `node_modules/`
- `.gradle/`
- `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`
- `.npm/`, `.yarn/`, `.pnpm-store/`
- `coverage/`, `.nyc_output/`, `htmlcov/`
- `*.log`, `logs/`
- `tmp/`, `*.tmp`, `*.cache`
- `*.class`

## Language/Framework/Library/Build Tool Additions
- If a language/framework/library/build tool doc includes a "VCS Ignore Additions" section,
  add those patterns when using it.
- Keep additions scoped to generated output and local tooling noise.
- Do not ignore files that are meant to be versioned for reproducible builds.

## IDE/Tooling Additions
Apply only when the tool is used:
- Xcode: `DerivedData/`, `*.xcworkspace`, `*.xcuserdatad`, `*.xcuserdata/`, `*.xcuserstate`, `*.xccheckout`
- Visual Studio: `.vs/`, `*.suo`, `*.user`, `*.userosscache`, `*.sln.docstates`,
  `*.VC.db`, `*.VC.opendb`
- Android Studio: `*.iml`, `local.properties`, `captures/`, `.externalNativeBuild/`
  (plus `.idea/`, `.gradle/`, `build/` if not already)

## Safeguards
- Do not commit secrets; rotate and remove them from history if exposed.
- Review ignore rules when adding new tools to avoid accidental leaks.
