# LIBRARY

Place library-specific rules in this directory.

## Selection Guidance
- Prefer mature, enterprise-ready libraries with a proven track record.
- Popularity is a strong indicator; widely adopted libraries are more likely to
  be maintained and supported long term.
- Prefer trustworthy stewardship (e.g., Apache Foundation, Linux Foundation,
  major vendors, or well-governed communities) over one-person side projects.
- Avoid adopting very new libraries without evidence of long-term sustainability.
- Favor clear release cadences, published support windows, and strong maintenance.
- Prefer comprehensive feature sets over hype-driven adoption.
- Ensure licenses are compatible with commercial closed-source use and that
  required attribution is provided; see `AI/COMPLIANCE/LICENSES.md`.
