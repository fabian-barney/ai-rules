# UPDATE

Instructions for AI agents to update ai-rules in a downstream repository.

## Prompt Examples
- "update ai-rules"
- "update ai-rules v2.0.0"

## Update Steps (run when requested)
1. Locate the vendored ai-rules path and entry point from `AGENTS.md` or README.
2. Determine the setup mode (local or git):
   - If the user explicitly specifies a mode, use it.
   - Otherwise auto-detect from the repository:
     - If `.git/info/exclude` contains any of these entries, treat this as local mode:
       /docs/ai/
       /AGENTS.md
       /AI_PROJECT.md
       /CLAUDE.md
       /.github/copilot-instructions.md
     - If `git ls-files <path>/AI/AI.md` returns a tracked file, treat this as git mode.
     - If it is ambiguous, ask which mode to use.
3. Determine the target version:
   - If the user specifies a tag, use it.
   - Otherwise, use the latest tagged release.
4. Update based on mode:
   - If it is git (tracked subtree):
     `git subtree pull --prefix <path> https://github.com/fabian-barney/ai-rules.git <ref> --squash`
     Commit the update.
   - If it is local (no commits, no push):
     - Temporarily remove the ai-rules entries from `.git/info/exclude`.
     - If `<path>` already exists locally, remove it only after confirming there is no real work in it.
     - Ensure Git has a local author identity configured (required for subtree add). If needed:
       `git config --local user.name "Your Name"`
       `git config --local user.email "you@example.com"`
     - Run:
       `git subtree add --prefix <path> https://github.com/fabian-barney/ai-rules.git <ref> --squash`
       (This creates a commit.)
     - Undo the commit but keep files:
       `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`
     - Re-add the exclude entries to `.git/info/exclude`.
5. Verify the baseline entry point still resolves (e.g., `<path>/AI/AI.md`).
6. Preserve local overlays and any project-specific rules outside the vendor path.
7. Record the updated version in the destination repository if it tracks versions.
8. Summarize changes.

## Mode Switch (when requested)
Prompt Examples:
- "mode ai-rules local"
- "mode ai-rules git"

Steps:
1. Detect the current mode using the same rules as the update flow.
2. If switching to local:
   - If already local, stop.
   - If currently git mode, confirm the user wants to remove ai-rules from version
     control for this repo. This requires a commit.
   - Remove tracked ai-rules paths but keep files:
     `git rm -r --cached <path> AGENTS.md AI_PROJECT.md CLAUDE.md .github/copilot-instructions.md`
     Note: This treats `AI_PROJECT.md` as local-only too. If the user wants it
     shared, confirm before removing it.
   - Add the local excludes to `.git/info/exclude` (keep the file intact):
     /docs/ai/
     /AGENTS.md
     /AI_PROJECT.md
     /CLAUDE.md
     /.github/copilot-instructions.md
   - Commit the removal. Ask the user whether to push this commit, and only push
     if they explicitly confirm.
3. If switching to git:
   - If already git, stop.
   - Remove the ai-rules entries from `.git/info/exclude` (keep the file intact):
     /docs/ai/
     /AGENTS.md
     /AI_PROJECT.md
     /CLAUDE.md
     /.github/copilot-instructions.md
   - If `<path>` exists locally, remove it only after confirming there is no real work in it.
   - Determine `<ref>`:
     - If the local ai-rules copy documents a version/tag (for example in `AGENTS.md`),
       reuse that tag.
     - Otherwise, use the latest tagged release.
   - Run:
     `git subtree add --prefix <path> https://github.com/fabian-barney/ai-rules.git <ref> --squash`
   - Create any missing entry points (for example `AGENTS.md` final references,
     `AI_PROJECT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`), ensure
     they are tracked, then commit and push.

## Expectations
- Prefer tagged releases unless explicitly asked for a branch.
- Do not overwrite local overlays or custom rules.
