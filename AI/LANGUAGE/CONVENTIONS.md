# CONVENTIONS

## Formatting
Formatting rules are ordered by precedence:
1. Standard, language-specific formatting rules (e.g., official formatters).
2. The conventions in this file.
3. Individual formatting preferences (lowest priority).

### Rules
- Follow standard language-specific formatters when they exist.
- It is not allowed to override standard formatting rules, even by team
  consensus.
- When no standard formatter exists, apply the conventions in this file and
  keep them consistent across the codebase.

## Naming Conventions
- Use English names by default.
- Non-English terms are allowed and encouraged when the project domain uses a
  specific term without a clear English translation or where the original term
  is more precise.
- Follow language-standard naming rules (e.g., class names, method names,
  constants).
- Abbreviations are forbidden unless they are widely known in general or in the
  project's domain.
- Treat an abbreviation as a single word for casing (e.g., `getUrl()` is
  correct; `getURL()` is incorrect).
- Prefer clear, descriptive names.
- Use consistent casing and prefixes within a codebase.
- Avoid misleading names; names must reflect intent.
