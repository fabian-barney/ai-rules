# AI Rules (Baseline)This repository contains shared, versioned AI guidance intended to be vendoredinto other projects (e.g., via git subtree). It is the single source of truthfor baseline agent rules across repositories.## Getting StartedRecommended AI agent: use the latest GPT Codex with *xhigh reasoning*. GPT Codexwithout *xhigh reasoning* is insufficient. If GPT Codex (xhigh) is notavailable, latest Opus might work as well, but expect it to be sloppy sometimes.### Initial setup1. Copy `AGENTS_TEMPLATE.md` into your project root as `AGENTS.md`.2. Ask your AI agent to set up ai-rules.   Example prompt:   ```   setup ai-rules with version v2.1.1   ```   If you omit the version, the latest tagged release will be used.### UpdateAsk your AI agent to update ai-rules when you want a newer version.Example prompt:```update ai-rules to version v2.1.1```If you omit the version, the latest tagged release will be used.## Structure- `AI/AI.md` - Single entry point for the entire ai-rules ruleset.- `AI/CORE/` - Non-negotiable baseline rules used across all projects.- `AI/AI-RULES/` - Maintenance guidance for this ruleset and release/update workflows.- `AI/REVIEW/` - Code review standards and checklists.- `AI/SECURITY/` - Security practices and safeguards.- `AI/TEST/` - Testing strategy and expectations.- `AI/LANGUAGE/` - Language and coding conventions.- `AI/DESIGN/` - Design principles and clean code guidance.- `AI/ARCHITECTURE/` - Architecture patterns and system design rules.- `AI/FRAMEWORK/` - Framework-specific guidance.- `AI/BUILD_TOOLS/` - Build and dependency management tooling.- `AI/LIBRARY/` - Library-specific guidance.- `AI/COMPLIANCE/` - Compliance and licensing rules.- `AI/CI-CD/` - CI/CD and automation guidance.- `AI/INFRASTRUCTURE/` - Infrastructure and platform guidance.## Contributing- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines for this repository.## Changelog- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history and notable changes.## Usage (git subtree)ai-rules can be vendored into another repository (for example with git subtree).This keeps the rules in sync while still allowing you to pin a specific version.You do not need to manage the mechanics manually if you use the AI prompts below.## VersioningTag releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and pin subtree updates to a tag when stabilityis required.
