# TYPESCRIPT

Guidance for TypeScript projects.

## General
- Enable strict mode and keep it enabled.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` or proper types instead.
- Prefer explicit types at module boundaries and public APIs.

## VCS Ignore Additions
Add these when using TypeScript (if not already covered by the baseline ignore list):
- `*.tsbuildinfo`
- `dist/`, `out/` when generated by the build
