# REACT

Guidance for React projects.

## Defaults
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.

## State and Data
- Keep state minimal and local where possible.
- Avoid prop drilling by introducing context sparingly.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize when it matters.

## Testing
- Keep unit tests fast and focused.
- Use integration tests for key user flows.
