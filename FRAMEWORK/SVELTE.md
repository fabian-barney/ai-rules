# SVELTE

Guidance for AI agents implementing and reviewing Svelte projects.

## Scope
- Define Svelte-specific component, reactivity, and state-management rules.
- Apply this file to Svelte/SvelteKit implementation and review tasks.

## Semantic Dependencies
- Inherit JavaScript baseline from `LANGUAGE/JAVASCRIPT/JAVASCRIPT.md`.
- Inherit HTML/CSS accessibility and semantics from
  `LANGUAGE/HTML/HTML.md` and `LANGUAGE/CSS/CSS.md`.
- Inherit cross-cutting constraints from
  `SECURITY/SECURITY.md`, `TEST/TEST.md`, `CORE/LOGGING.md`.

## Defaults
- Keep components focused and small.
- Prefer explicit props/events/store boundaries over hidden cross-component
  coupling.
- Keep business logic outside template markup when complexity grows.
- Prefer derived/reactive values for view state over duplicated mutable state.

## Reactivity and State Rules
- Keep one source of truth for each state concern.
- Avoid cascading reactive statements that create implicit update loops.
- Use stores for cross-component/shared state.
- Keep component-local state local unless there is clear sharing need.
- Avoid mutating shared objects in-place without explicit intent.

## Side Effects and Lifecycle
- Keep side effects explicit in lifecycle hooks.
- Clean up subscriptions/listeners/timers in teardown paths.
- Avoid running heavy side effects during rendering paths.
- Guard browser-only APIs when SSR/hydration is relevant.

## Template and Accessibility
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible controls.
- Ensure keyboard/focus behavior for interactive elements.
- Keep template expressions simple; extract complex logic into script section.
- Avoid duplicated conditional fragments when component extraction improves
  readability.

## Performance Baseline
- Avoid unnecessary store subscriptions and broad reactive dependencies.
- Use keyed each-blocks for stable list updates.
- Keep expensive computations memoized/derived outside repeated render logic.
- Split large components by feature boundary.

## High-Risk Pitfalls
1. Hidden reactive dependency chains causing update surprises.
2. In-place mutations not triggering expected updates.
3. Missing cleanup for subscriptions/timers.
4. Heavy logic embedded directly in template expressions.
5. Non-keyed list rendering causing DOM/state mismatch.
6. Browser API usage without SSR guards.

## Do / Don't Examples
### 1. Shared State
```text
Don't: duplicate same value in multiple local component states.
Do:    keep shared state in a store and derive local projections.
```

### 2. Cleanup
```text
Don't: create interval in onMount without clearInterval on destroy.
Do:    always pair setup with teardown.
```

### 3. List Rendering
```text
Don't: each block without stable key for dynamic lists.
Do:    keyed list rendering with stable identity.
```

## Code Review Checklist for Svelte
- Are component boundaries focused and cohesive?
- Is state ownership clear (local vs shared store)?
- Are reactive dependencies explicit and loop-safe?
- Are side effects lifecycle-safe with cleanup?
- Are templates semantic, accessible, and readable?
- Are list/render performance considerations handled?
- Are SSR/browser boundaries guarded where needed?

## Testing Guidance
- Add unit tests for state/reactive logic.
- Add component tests for key interaction/accessibility behaviors.
- Test lifecycle cleanup behavior (subscriptions/timers/listeners).
- Add integration tests for critical user flows.
- If SSR is used, test browser-guarded paths and hydration behavior.

## Override Notes
- Project-specific SvelteKit conventions may add routing/data-loading rules, but
  reactivity clarity, cleanup safety, and accessibility constraints remain
  mandatory.
