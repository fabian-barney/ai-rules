# SVELTE

Guidance for Svelte projects.

## Defaults
- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer simple stores for shared state.
- Keep logic out of markup when it becomes complex.

## State and Data
- Use stores for cross-component state.
- Keep side effects explicit and contained.

## Testing
- Keep unit tests fast and focused.
- Use integration tests for key user flows.
