# ARCHITECTURE

Architecture-layer contract for system design, boundaries, and interaction
patterns.

## Role in the Ruleset
- ARCHITECTURE docs define structural constraints that guide implementation in
  frameworks and libraries.
- Architecture guidance inherits cross-cutting and language baselines and then
  adds system-level design rules.
- Global precedence and override behavior are defined in
  `CORE/RULE_DEPENDENCY_TREE.md`.

## Scope Boundary
ARCHITECTURE includes:
- Service/system boundaries and dependency direction.
- API style and integration pattern constraints.
- Architecture-level performance/resilience and consistency guardrails.

ARCHITECTURE does not include:
- Framework lifecycle/state/rendering details.
- Library API-level coding guidance.
- Build/deploy/runtime infrastructure procedures.

Those belong in `FRAMEWORK/**`, `LIBRARY/**`, `BUILD_TOOLS/**`,
`INFRASTRUCTURE/**`, and `CI-CD/**`.

## Specialization Contract
- Pattern documents may specialize architecture constraints for specific styles
  (for example event-driven, REST, GraphQL).
- Architecture docs may narrow/extend parent guidance, but must not weaken
  inherited mandatory security/compliance/testing constraints unless an upstream
  parent rule explicitly marks that behavior optional.
- Framework/library docs may specialize architecture guidance only with explicit
  justification in those specialized docs.

## Authoring Notes
- Keep this file index-level and boundary-focused.
- Put deep pattern behavior in child architecture docs.
- When adding a new architecture doc, update this index and align semantic
  dependencies in `CORE/RULE_DEPENDENCY_TREE.md`.
