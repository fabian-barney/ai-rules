# Security Policy

This file defines the repository security disclosure process for GitHub.

## Scope and Demarcation
- This policy is for reporting vulnerabilities in this repository and its
  published artifacts.
- This policy is not the same as `SECURITY/SECURITY.md`, which contains
  engineering guidance for secure implementation and review.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Support level |
| --- | --- |
| `main` branch | Yes |
| Latest tagged release | Yes |
| Older tags/releases | No |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
1. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for this repository via
   [GitHub private security advisories](https://github.com/fabian-barney/ai-rules/security/advisories/new).
   If this policy is reused in another repository, update the owner/repo link accordingly.
2. Do not open a public GitHub issue for vulnerability details.
3. Include:
   - affected file/rule and version/ref,
   - reproduction steps or proof of concept,
   - impact assessment,
   - suggested remediation if available.

## Response Expectations
- Initial triage response target: within 5 business days.
- Valid reports will be tracked privately until a fix is ready.
- Disclosure timing should follow coordinated disclosure practices.
