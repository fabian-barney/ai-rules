# 2026-02-01-release-version-examples

## Scope
- Applies only to this repository.
- Do not copy these rules into consuming projects.

## Issue
During the v2.1.0 and v2.1.1 releases, versioned example prompts in README.md
were not updated before creating the release commit and tag. This resulted in
the release tag containing outdated version references, requiring a follow-up
commit after the release.

The release instructions in RELEASE.md step 4 clearly stated to update versioned
examples, but the step was skipped.

## Prevention
Before creating the release commit:
1. Search for the previous version string (e.g., `v2.1.0`) across all files.
2. Update every occurrence in example prompts to the new version.
3. Verify the changes are staged before committing.

Checklist for AI agents:
- [ ] Run `git grep "vX.Y.Z"` (previous version) to find all references.
- [ ] Update README.md example prompts.
- [ ] Check for version references in any other documentation.
- [ ] Stage all version updates with the changelog in the same commit.
- [ ] Only then create the annotated tag.
