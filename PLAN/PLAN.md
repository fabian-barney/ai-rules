# PLAN

Guidance for creating execution plans.

## When to Plan
- Use a plan for multi-step, risky, or high-impact work.
- Skip detailed planning for trivial changes; proceed directly.

## Plan Contents
- Goal and success criteria (what "done" means).
- Scope boundaries and non-goals.
- Assumptions and open questions.
- Dependencies, risks, and rollback considerations.
- Verification strategy and test plan.

## Test Planning Requirements
- Add missing tests before modifying behavior when current behavior is unclear.
- Add tests for new code or changed behavior.
- Run the tests and verify they succeed; state if tests were not run.

## Plan Format
- Use short, ordered steps with clear outcomes.
- Keep steps small enough to validate independently.
- Update the plan if scope or assumptions change.
